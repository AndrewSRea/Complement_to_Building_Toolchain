# A side project built from instructions from the My_Learning_Port folder

Using the tooling knowledge learned from instructions from this folder path, `My_Learning_Port/JavaScript/Tools_and_Testing/Client-side_Web_Dev_Tools/Intro_Toolchain` and `-/Deploying_App`, the program here was built through the process of building up a sample case study toolchain, by setting up a sensible development environment and putting transformation tools in place to actually deploy this app on Netlify. 

The toolchain created here is used to build and deploy a mini site that lists data (taken from one of NASA's open APIs) concerning potentially hazardous space objects that threaten our existence here on Earth.

## Tools used in this toolchain

* JavaScript
* JSX
* Prettier
* eslint
* PostCSS
* Parcel
* GitHub
* Netlify
